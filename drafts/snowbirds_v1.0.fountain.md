FADE IN:

EXT. LAKE TAHOE - DAY

The sun sparkles on crystal blue water. A luxury wake boat slices through the lake, pulling ZACK (19, cocky, athletic) who attempts a complex trick - the WHIRLYBIRD: tantrum into front flip with 360, no handle pass.

He nails it partially, splashes down laughing.

ZACK
Dude, these Tahoe hotties are like our wake - wet, wild, and ready to ride!

KYLE (19, his twin, goofy, follows along) cheers from the boat with party girls.

KYLE
That wave hit harder than last night's threesome - left me soaked and breathless!

Montage: Partying, money thrown, stupid stunts. They ignore a phone call from parents.

ZACK
Mom's ringing? Tell her we're busy 'studying' anatomy with the locals.

CUT TO:

EXT. TAHOE PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Wild party. Zack and Kyle plan to show off.

ZACK
Tomorrow, we nail the Whirlybird for the camera. California Beach State won't know what hit 'em!

KYLE
Uh, like, is that legal? Or... should we maybe not?

They laugh, dismiss college talk.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKESIDE VENUE - DAY

Elderly community at luncheon for beloved cat. Urn ready for ashes scattering.

Zack and Kyle boat nearby, drunk.

ZACK
Whoops, gave granny a golden shower - bet that's the most action she's had since the 70s!

KYLE
Hey old timer, is that a cane or are you just happy to see me?

They attempt Whirlybird to show off. Crash into dock.

Chaos: dock collapses, urn in lake, seniors soaked.

KYLE
Shit, the urn's in the lake - now pussy's really wet!

ZACK
We just turned their lunch into a wet T-shirt contest for seniors - boobs sagging like their stocks!

Video is filmed. They flee laughing.

CUT TO:

INT. TAHOE HOUSE - NIGHT

Parents on phone, show video.

PARENTS
You destroyed everything! Costs $90K - your college fund is gone.

ZACK
Come on, it was an accident - like that time I pulled out too late.

KYLE
The old folks are fine - wet but alive, unlike my sex life after this.

CUT TO:

INT. TAHOE HOUSE - DAY

Ultimatum.

PARENTS
Military or Florida to work for grandparents in their retirement community. Live in employee housing, no perks.

ZACK
No credit cards? How do we buy condoms now?

They choose Florida.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Coach class.

KYLE
Coach class? This seat's tighter than a virgin on prom night.

CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Grandparents pick up in golf cart.

KYLE
Feels like a graveyard - bet the only thing rising here is the dead!

ZACK
Gramps, you still got it? Or is that Viagra in your pocket?

CUT TO:

INT. GRANDPARENTS' CONDO - DAY

Tour nice condo. Grandparents leave on cruise.

Shown dump housing and caretaker jobs.

ZACK
Finally, a bed that doesn't smell like old balls.

CUT TO:

INT. DUMP APARTMENT - NIGHT

Complain.

KYLE
This dump's tighter than a nun's - how do we even jack off in here?

KYLE
The only wakes around here are on the land!

CUT TO:

EXT. COMMUNITY - DAY

Explore, find wake facility.

ZACK
Holy shit, a wake lake? These old farts are hiding the good stuff!

KYLE
65+ only? Guess we gotta fake it till we make it - like my last date.

Learn about Miami contest, $75K prize.

ZACK
$75K? That's enough for hookers and blow for life!

Plan to disguise.

CUT TO:

INT. DUMP APARTMENT - NIGHT

Discuss prize for California Beach State.

KYLE
Dress as old people? Hope my disguise doesn't slip like my condom last week.

CUT TO:

INT. DUMP APARTMENT - DAY

Disguise attempt.

KYLE
I look like grandma after a bad perm - smells like mothballs and regret.

ZACK
This foundation's thicker than my ex's lies - hope it covers my boner.

KYLE
These pants are looser than a hooker's morals.

ZACK
Hunch like this? Feels like I'm smuggling a hard-on.

KYLE
We look like death - bet we'd still get laid in this place!

It works.

FADE OUT.

You handle old people? Bet you could handle my young equipment.

DELIA

ZACK
Garage door open? That's code for 'come swing with my saggy balls'?

Old lady just grabbed my ass - feels like a prune with attitude.

They're swapping more than stories - grandpa's got game!
