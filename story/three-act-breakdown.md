## ACT 1: THE FALL (Pages 1-25)

### Opening Image (Page 1)
**Visual:** Zack and Kyle wakeboarding in Lake Tahoe, luxury boat, beautiful girls, partying—living the ultimate rich kid summer fantasy.

**Establishes:** Their privilege, skills, immaturity, and total lack of respect for consequences.

---

### Setup (Pages 1-10)
**The Brothers' World:**
- Zack (20) and Kyle (19) are wealthy SF trust fund bros
- Summer at family's Tahoe house
- Crazy wake boat, endless parties, womanizing
- Training for "ultimate trick" but mostly just partying
- Zero jobs, zero responsibilities, zero values
- Parents' money pays for everything

**Key Scenes:**
- [ ] Wakeboarding montage showing their skills and lifestyle
- [ ] Partying scene establishing their disrespect and entitlement

- [ ] Parents calling (ignored) about their future/college

**Characters Introduced:** Zack, Kyle, parents (phone/brief appearance)

### Inciting Incident (Page 12)
**THE BIG MISTAKE:**

**The Ashes Luncheon**

- A beloved elderly couple's longtime pet cat—who has been part of the retirement community for decades—has just passed away.
- The community hosts a lakeside memorial luncheon on the Tahoe shore, complete with white tents, floral arrangements, framed photos, and a silent auction to raise money for pets in need.
- The cat's ashes are set to be scattered ceremonially into the lake by the couple and their closest friends.

**What Happens:**
- Zack & Kyle are hosting their own reckless party nearby (drinking, wakeboarding, showing off for friends).
- They get too close to the luncheon dock, splash the guests, and mock the seniors on the dock.
- In a desperate attempt to show off their "ultimate trick," they wipe out the wake boat and crash into the dock.
- The collision knocks over the ceremonial urn, sending the cat's ashes into the water, along with the memorial display, expensive decorations, and items from the silent auction.
- Elderly guests are drenched, a few are injured, and the couple's last moment with their cat is ruined.

**Consequences:**
- The incident is filmed (someone captures it for social media) and goes viral.
- The retirement community is outraged; the mayor/founder is personally humiliated.
- Damage bills include the dock, tents, memorial props, auction items, medical expenses, and a new urn/memorial service.
- The parents see the footage, realize the severity, and immediately cut the boys off—college fund gone, privileges revoked.

**Requirements Achieved:**
- Cost is enormous (dock repairs + charity payments + emotional restitution).
- Directly disrespects elderly people and the symbolism of the ceremony.
- The cat ashes in the lake provide emotional weight while staying darkly comedic.
- Shows the brothers at their absolute worst and provides solid justification for the fallout.

---

### Consequences & Decision (Pages 12-25)
**The Fallout:**
- Parents find out (video evidence? Police called?)
- Damage costs $[AMOUNT]—entire college fund
- Parents are DONE enabling them

**The Ultimatum (Page 20):**
- "College is off the table. You destroyed it."
- "Figure it out yourselves OR join the military"
- "You're spending the rest of summer with your grandparents in Florida"
- "You can't get in any more trouble there"
- Parents take: boat, cars, credit cards, EVERYTHING

**The Journey:**
- Brothers forced to fly to Florida (coach, not first class)
- Arriving at retirement community
- Culture shock—golf carts, old people everywhere, feels like "a graveyard"

**The Scheme:**
- Corrupt admin helping him (name?)
- Blocking residents' maintenance fees/services
- [Drugging residents to make them seem incompetent?]
- Making them want to leave/forcing them out
- Legal loopholes, intimidation

**Brand & Chad—Developer's Sons:**

- Back in the dump apartment
- Everything they tried failed
- Hurt everyone they came to care about
- Can't win competition without training
- Can't save community
- Girls hate them
- Grandparents return—disappointed

**The Realization:**
- They've become their worst selves again (lying, selfish)
- BUT they actually changed—they DO care now
- Prize money doesn't matter if people they love suffer
- Need to make it right
- Not about the money—about doing the right thing

**The Decision:**
- Even if they can't compete or win

---

## KEY DECISIONS STILL NEEDED

### Critical for Act 1:
1. **What do they ruin?** (Drives entire plot)
2. **How much does it cost?** (Stakes)
3. **Their last name?**

### Critical for Act 2:
4. **Who are Daisy & Delia specifically?** (Jobs, personalities, backstories)
5. **How does Rick Vantrell's scheme work?** (Need specifics)
6. **Who is the corrupt admin?** (Name, role, motivation)
7. **How do they get exposed?** (Specific scene)

### Critical for Act 3:
8. **How do they expose the scheme?** (Specific plan)
9. **Does competition happen in Miami or elsewhere?** (Major structural choice)
10. **Do they win the competition?** (Then give away money? Or lose but it doesn't matter?)
11. **How do they pay for college?** (Final resolution)
12. **What's the ultimate trick called?** (Visual centerpiece)

### Character Details:
13. **Their old person disguise names?**
14. **Grandparents' names and personalities?**
15. **Corrupt admin's name?**
16. **What year exactly?** (Suggest 1997-1998)

---

## THEMATIC THROUGHLINE

**Act 1:** Entitlement and Disrespect  
**Act 2A:** Deception and Discovery (learning while lying)  
**Act 2B:** Guilt and Consequences (lies catching up)  
**Act 3:** Sacrifice and Redemption (doing right thing even at cost)

**Character Arc:** Taking → Receiving → Giving

**Message:** Respect is earned. Value comes from who you are, not what you have. The elderly have lived full lives worth honoring. Real growth requires sacrifice.

---
