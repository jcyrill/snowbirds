# Story Outline v1 - Snow Birds

Based on original notes - organized into three-act structure

---

## ACT 1 - LAKE TAHOE

### Setup - Rich Kids Paradise
- **Location:** San Francisco wealth → Lake Tahoe summer house
- **Characters:** Zack & Kyle- twins, rich party boys from SF
- **Lifestyle:** Wakeboarding with crazy wake boat, drinking, womanizing, zero responsibility
- **Goals:** Get into California Beach State—the ultimate 90s party school (the “Gronk at Arizona State” of the west coast)
- **Activity** Working on the "Whirlybird" (a tantrum into a front flip with a 360 and no handle pass)
- **Problems:** No jobs, don't care about future or values, everything handed to them

### Inciting Incident
- The retirement community hosts a lakeside luncheon honoring a beloved resident's pet cat (a furry mascot of the village). The cat's ashes are about to be scattered into Tahoe.
- Zack & Kyle, drunk and partying nearby, get too close to the dock and splash elderly guests while mocking them.
- In a desperate attempt to show off the "ultimate trick," they crash their wake boat into the ceremonial setup, knocking the urn into the lake along with the memorial display and expensive auction items.
- The cat's ashes are lost in the water, the seniors are soaked/injured, and the community is humiliated.

### Consequences
- Parents find out, costs lots of money to fix
- Parents use the boys' COLLEGE FUND to pay for damages
- **Ultimatum:** Figure out college on your own OR join the military
- **Punishment:** Sent to Florida to work for their grandparents
  - Grandparents secured them jobs at the retirement community, living in the employee housing (a dump compared to their Tahoe pad)
  - Parents cut them off financially; no vehicles or perks

### Act 1 Break (Page 25)
- Brothers arrive in Florida, everything changes

---

## ACT 2A - FLORIDA ARRIVAL

### New World - "Feels Like a Graveyard"
- Arrive at Villages-style retirement community
- No cars allowed (golf carts only), no nothing
- Designed so they can't get in trouble
- Grandparents' condo is surprisingly nice

### Complication
- **Grandparents leave on cruise** - house is empty
- Brothers are alone with no money, no future, no college
- Where they're supposed to be living is "a fucking dump"
- But grandparents' condo is super nice

### Discovery - The Facility
- They discover: **World-class wakeboarding facility** in the community
- Crazy good boat, professional setup
- **Miami wakeboarding contest** coming up with PRIZE MONEY
  - Enough to pay back parents and go to college!
- **Problem:** "Only for residents 65 and older"

### The Plan - Disguise
- Decide to dress up as old people to access facility
- Disguises look horrible
- **BUT:** Everyone is old, can't see, can't tell the difference
- Start training in secret

### B-Story - The Nurses
- Daisy & Delia are nurses (or nurse assistants) assigned to the retirement community's health wing.
- They're both kind, grounded, and tired of the usual entitled guys—they genuinely care for the seniors because they are lonely and miss being seen.
- They see through the brothers' bullshit but are drawn to their vulnerability when the brothers start helping residents instead of just hiding.
- Daisy is practical, sharp-witted, and quietly in charge of the community's activities board.
- Delia is more openly compassionate, always sitting in on therapy groups and making sure residents have someone to talk to.
- The brothers' disguises (and their waking up at the facility) made them want to quit, but Daisy & Delia convince them to stay by showing the old people have depth and deserve respect.
- Romance sparks when Zack & Kyle start showing real character—Daisy & Delia become their emotional anchors and moral compasses.

### The Raunchy World
- Discover old people are VERY raunchy when alone
- Villages culture: garage door signals, flamingos in yard, swinger culture
- Subverts their expectations about elderly people

### Actually Being Good People
- Begin helping lonely old people
- Start learning life lessons
- Building genuine connections
- Character growth begins

### Midpoint (Page 55) - Getting Caught
- **One brother gets caught** (Kyle?)
- **Forced to sleep with noisy neighbor** to keep secret
- Stakes are raised
- Comedy escalates

## ACT 2B - COMPLICATIONS

### Antagonists Arrive
- **Evil real estate developer** introduced
  - Wants to take over community
  - Plan: Turn residents into "zombies" with drugs
  - Can take out all the facilities that make living worth it. ALl the old people will be on drugs and barely living.
  
- **Corrupt retirement admin** 
  - In on the scam
  - Stopping residents' fees from being paid properly
  - Creates obstacles for brothers

- **Developer's two sons**
  - ALSO rich dicks who wakeboard
  - ALSO chasing the same girls
  - Everything Zack & Kyle were at beginning
  - Will compete at Miami contest

### Rising Conflicts
- Brothers trying to:
  - Maintain disguises
  - Train for competition
  - Romance the girls
  - Help the old people
  - Avoid getting caught again
  - Uncover the developer's scheme

### Love vs. Lies
- Girls start to really like them
- But brothers are lying about disguises
- Growing guilt about deception

### All Is Lost 
- **Get fully caught / exposed**
- **Lose the girls** (feel betrayed)
- **Lose boat access** (kicked out of facility)
- Developer scheme about to succeed
- No way to compete in Miami
- Everything falls apart

## ACT 3 - REDEMPTION

### Everyone Knows
- It turns out the entire retirement community figured out Zack & Kyle’s disguise weeks ago.
- Instead of exposing them, the residents kept the secret because they enjoyed the company and wanted to see them grow.
- Now that the brothers have been caught, the seniors rally around them, offering help rather than condemnation.
- They reveal that the old people aren’t naive—they knew all along, and now they want the boys to win the competition as proof that they deserve a second chance.

### New Plan
- The community chips in using their connections:
  - One retiree has a contact at the Miami wakeboard circuit and arranges an official last-minute entry.
  - Another resident is a retired sports physiologist who keeps the brothers in shape.
  - Daisy & Delia advocate on their behalf, vouching for their hard work helping the village.

### The Competition
- Brothers show up in Miami with the community cheering them on remotely (phone calls, fan mail, maybe a few seniors on a budget trip).
- They face Brand & Chad in the final run.
- They land the "Whirlybird" they’ve been rehearsing—a tantrum into a front flip with a 360 and no handle pass—win the prize, and raise their profile.
- Prize money would be enough for college, but they realize their growth is tied to the community.
- They decide to funnel the winnings into paying off the hidden debt the developers had been using to pressure the residents (so Rick can't weaponize it again).

### Resolution
- After the win, Daisy & Delia see the brothers make the right choice.
- The community is saved: drug scheme collapsed, facilities stabilized, residents relieved.
- They quietly use the prize money to cover the hidden debt the developer had leveraged against the community, keeping their involvement secret from officials so the admin can't weaponize it again.
- One of the retirees runs a scholarship fund for adults reentering education (started after a widower's late wife donated). They nominate Zack & Kyle, securing their college futures without touching the prize money.
- Parents hear about the brothers' transformation, admit they were wrong to cut them off, and commit to supporting them on the condition they stay grounded and keep helping the community.

### Final Image
- Zack & Kyle sit in a college lecture hall or study room, textbooks open, laptops with research tabs, clearly more academically focused.
- Daisy & Delia help lead a discussion or lab, guiding the brothers while also mentoring other community members returning to school.
- The seniors, now acting as tutors or mentors, write notes on “life lessons” cards and hang them on the classroom wall—proof they’ve become a part of both worlds.

## THEMES

- **Respect for elders** - primary theme
- **Earning vs. entitlement** - work for what matters
- **Friendship/brotherhood** - brothers' relationship evolves
- **Superficial vs. genuine values** - what really matters
- **Appearances vs. reality** - old people aren't what they seem, neither are the brothers

## NOTES

- Keep the 80s raunchy sex comedy tone while set in 90s
- Old people should be surprisingly raunchy - subverts expectations and removes judgment
- Developer's sons serve as "what they could have stayed" mirror
- Florida setting allows for unique comedy (Villages culture, heat, retiree lifestyle)
- Wakeboarding is unusual sport for comedy - visual, exciting, athletic
