## ACT 1 - LAKE TAHOE (Pages 1-25)

### Setup - Rich Kids Paradise
- **Location:** San Francisco wealth → Lake Tahoe summer house
- **Characters:** Zack & Kyle, rich party boys from SF
- **Lifestyle:** Wakeboarding with crazy wake boat, drinking, womanizing, zero responsibility
- **Goals:** Get to party colege
- **Activitie** Working on "ultimate trick" for future competition
- **Problems:** No jobs, don't care about future or values, everything handed to them

### Inciting Incident
- The retirement community hosts a lakeside luncheon honoring a beloved resident's pet cat (a furry mascot of the village). The cat's ashes are about to be scattered into Tahoe.
- Zack & Kyle, drunk and partying nearby, get too close to the dock and splash elderly guests while mocking them.
- In a desperate attempt to show off the "ultimate trick," they crash their wake boat into the ceremonial setup, knocking the urn into the lake along with the memorial display and expensive auction items.
- The cat's ashes are lost in the water, the seniors are soaked/injured, and the community is humiliated.

### Consequences
- Parents find out, costs lots of money to fix
- Parents use the boys' COLLEGE FUND to pay for damages

## THEMES

- **Respect for elders** - primary theme
- **Earning vs. entitlement** - work for what matters
- **Friendship/brotherhood** - brothers' relationship evolves
- **Superficial vs. genuine values** - what really matters
- **Appearances vs. reality** - old people aren't what they seem, neither are the brothers

## NOTES

- Keep the 80s raunchy sex comedy tone while set in 90s
- Old people should be surprisingly raunchy - subverts expectations and removes judgment
- Developer's sons serve as "what they could have stayed" mirror
- Florida setting allows for unique comedy (Villages culture, heat, retiree lifestyle)
- Wakeboarding is unusual sport for comedy - visual, exciting, athletic
