---

## Background

**Family:**  
Wealthy San Francisco family. Parents have money but are frustrated with sons' lack of direction. Has enabled them until now. Relationship is loving but exasperated - parents at wit's end.

**Education:**  
Private schools his whole life. Decent grades because school was easy and parents could "help." Never had to work for anything. Was star of water sports team. Popular.

**Formative Experience:**  
[TO DEVELOP] - Has always had everything handed to him. Never faced real consequences. This Florida trip is his first real adversity.

**Current Life Situation:**  
Living the ultimate summer - unlimited money, Tahoe house, wake boat, hot tubs, parties. Zero concerns about future. College was assumed, not earned.

## Goals & Motivations

**External Goal (What they WANT):**  
Win prize money at Miami wakeboarding competition to restore college fund and get life back on track. Access to training facility. Girls.

**Internal Need (What they NEED):**  
Learn respect (especially for elders), develop work ethic, understand that relationships and values matter more than status and money. Needs to actually EARN something for once.

**Fears:**  
- Being ordinary / average
- Losing status
- Having to actually work
- Being old someday (ironic)
- His parents were right about him

**Secrets:**  
- Actually anxious about future (hides it with bravado)
- Knows they were assholes in Tahoe
- Worried he has no real skills beyond wakeboarding

---

## Relationships

**With Kyle (brother):**  
Protective but also leads him astray. Natural leader dynamic. Takes him for granted. Their relationship will deepen as they face adversity together.

**With Parents:**  
Loving but dismissive. Doesn't take their concerns seriously. Sees them as ATMs and rule-makers. Will have to earn respect back.

**With Grandparents:**  
Barely knows them. Visits are obligatory and boring to him. Sees them as "old and irrelevant." This will change.

**With The Girls:**  
Starts with typical player approach - charm and conquest. Will develop genuine feelings and have to learn what real connection means.

**With Elderly Community:**  
Starts with contempt and condescension. Through forced interaction and disguise, learns they're actually people with rich lives, wisdom, and (surprisingly) still know how to have fun.

## Character Arc

**Starting Point:**  
Spoiled, entitled rich kid who sees people (especially elderly) as either useful or irrelevant. No respect, no values, no work ethic. Charming but selfish.

**Transformation:**  
Forced proximity and disguise makes him actually SEE elderly people as humans. Helping them creates unexpected connections. Falling for a girl who has real values challenges his worldview. Realizing developer's sons are mirror of who he is disgusts him.

**Ending Point:**  
Still charming and athletic, but now has genuine respect and empathy. Understands earning vs. entitlement. Values relationships over status. Willing to sacrifice his prize money for what's right. Becomes someone his brother can actually look up to.

**Key Moments:**  
1. The Tahoe incident - rock bottom behavior
2. First time in old person disguise - forced humility
3. [Specific scene with elderly person that touches him]
4. Realizing developer's sons are who he was
5. Choosing community over prize money
6. [Honest moment with the girl he loves]

## Voice & Dialogue

**Speech Patterns:**  
90s bro-speak. "Dude," "bro," "awesome," "radical," "gnarly" for wakeboarding stuff. Uses sports metaphors. Casual grammar. Talks fast when excited.

**Sample Lines:**  
- "Dude, we are SO dialed in right now!"
- "Old people? They just like, sit around and complain about stuff."
- "Whatever, we'll figure it out. We always do."
- [After character growth] "That's not cool, man. These people deserve better."

**90s References They'd Make:**  
MTV, X-Games, Pauly Shore movies, Tommy Boy, action sports videos, Blink-182, surf/skate culture

---

## Role in Comedy

**Comedy Type:**  
Arrogant fool who gets humiliated. Physical comedy through disguise. Straight man to even dumber brother sometimes. Creator of chaos.

**Running Gags:**  
- Disguise almost falling off
- Using old person voice at wrong times
- Wakeboarding lingo in wrong contexts
- [To develop more]

**Comedic Relationships:**  
Plays well off Kyle (dumb and dumber dynamic), the girls (they see through BS), elderly people (they mess with him)

---

## 90s-Specific Details

**Technology:**  
Has a pager. Eventually gets a cell phone (brick-sized, expensive). Uses pay phones. No concept of email.

**Music Taste:**  
Alternative rock, punk, rap-rock. Blink-182, Green Day, Offspring, maybe some hip-hop to seem cool. Limp Bizkit/Korn era. Definitely not "old people music."

**TV Shows They Watch:**  
MTV, The Simpsons, South Park, wrestling, X-Games, ESPN, maybe Friends to understand girl references

**Cultural References:**  
Blockbuster rentals, arcade games, mall culture, action sports videos, getting film developed, MTV Spring Break

## Visual Reference

**Actor/Celebrity Comp:**  
- Young Ryan Reynolds energy (Van Wilder era)
- Chris Pratt (Andy Dwyer level dumb but lovable)
- Paul Walker (Fast & Furious bro charm)
- Young Bradley Cooper (cocky but capable of depth)

**Style Icons:**  
Pro wakeboarders of 90s, X-Games athletes, SoCal surf/skate culture

## Notes & Ideas

- His arc is more dramatic than Kyle's - he's the one who really needs to change
- The disguise should be terrible but everyone's fooled because they're all old
- Moment where he actually enjoys talking to an elderly person about their life
- Should have a "come to Jesus" moment where he realizes he's wasted his privilege
- His wakeboarding skill should actually be legitimate - he's not talentless, just directionless
- Final trick should require trust/teamwork with Kyle - can't do it alone
