---

## Background

**Family:**  
Wealthy San Francisco family. Parents have money but are frustrated with sons' lack of direction. Has enabled them until now. Relationship is loving but exasperated - parents at wit's end.

**Education:**  
Private schools his whole life. Decent grades because school was easy and parents could "help." Never had to work for anything. Was star of water sports team. Popular.

**Formative Experience:**  
[TO DEVELOP] - Has always had everything handed to him. Never faced real consequences. This Florida trip is his first real adversity.

**Current Life Situation:**  
Living the ultimate summer - unlimited money, Tahoe house, wake boat, hot tubs, parties. Zero concerns about future. College was assumed, not earned.

## Goals & Motivations

**External Goal (What they WANT):**  
Get into California Beach State (ultimate party school) by winning prize money at Miami wakeboarding competition to restore college fund. Master the Whirlybird trick. Access to training facility. Girls.

**Internal Need (What they NEED):**  
Learn respect (especially for elders), develop work ethic, understand that relationships and values matter more than status and money. Needs to actually EARN something for once.

**Fears:**  
- Being ordinary / average
- Losing status
- Having to actually work
- Being old someday (ironic)
- His parents were right about him

**Secrets:**  
- Actually anxious about future (hides it with bravado)
- Knows they were assholes in Tahoe
- Worried he has no real skills beyond wakeboarding

---

## Relationships

**With Kyle (twin brother):**  
Protective but also leads him astray. Natural leader dynamic. Takes him for granted. Their relationship will deepen as they face adversity together.

**With Parents:**  
Loving but dismissive. Doesn't take their concerns seriously. Sees them as ATMs and rule-makers. Will have to earn respect back.

**With Grandparents:**  
Barely knows them. Visits are obligatory and boring to him. Sees them as "old and irrelevant." This will change.

**With Daisy (love interest):**  
Starts with typical player approach - charm and conquest. Will develop genuine feelings and have to learn what real connection means. She's his moral compass.

**With Elderly Community:**  
Starts with contempt and condescension. Through forced interaction and disguise, learns they're actually people with rich lives, wisdom, and (surprisingly) still know how to have fun.

---

## Character Arc

**Starting Point:**  
Spoiled, entitled rich kid who sees people (especially elderly) as either useful or irrelevant. No respect, no values, no work ethic. Charming but selfish.

**Transformation:**  
Forced proximity and disguise makes him actually SEE elderly people as humans. Helping them creates unexpected connections. Falling for a girl who has real values challenges his worldview. Realizing developer's sons are mirror of who he is disgusts him.

**Ending Point:**  
Still charming and athletic, but now has genuine respect and empathy. Understands earning vs. entitlement. Values relationships over status. Willing to sacrifice his prize money for what's right. Becomes someone his brother can actually look up to.

**Key Moments:**  
1. The Tahoe incident - rock bottom behavior
2. First time in old person disguise - forced humility
3. [Specific scene with elderly person that touches him]
4. Realizing developer's sons are who he was
5. Choosing community over prize money
6. [Honest moment with the girl he loves]

## Notes & Ideas

- His arc is more dramatic than Kyle's - he's the one who really needs to change
- The disguise should be terrible but everyone's fooled because they're all old
- Moment where he actually enjoys talking to an elderly person about their life
- Should have a "come to Jesus" moment where he realizes he's wasted his privilege
- His wakeboarding skill should actually be legitimate - he's not talentless, just directionless
- Final trick should require trust/teamwork with Kyle - can't do it alone
