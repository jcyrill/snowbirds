**Sense of Humor:**  
Goofy physical comedy. Laughs at everything. More "Wayne's World" than "Beavis and Butt-Head." Doesn't get jokes right away. Unintentionally funny.

---

## Background

**Family:**  
Same wealthy family, but as younger brother he's gotten even less discipline. Zack gets expectations, Kyle gets indulgence. Parents love him but don't take him as seriously.

**Education:**  
Same private schools. Worse grades than Zack. Barely graduating. Probably had to be tutored. Social not academic. Popular because he's funny and harmless.

**Formative Experience:**  
Has always followed Zack. Doesn't know who he is without his brother. Never had to figure it out.

**Current Life Situation:**  
Living Zack's life one step behind. Happy to be along for the ride. College wasn't his idea - parents' expectation. No clue what he actually wants.

---

## Goals & Motivations

**External Goal (What they WANT):**  
Same as Zack initially - get into California Beach State by winning money, get to college, make parents happy, have fun. But he's less driven about it. Master the Whirlybird trick.

**Internal Need (What they NEED):**  
Find his own identity separate from Zack. Learn to make his own decisions. Discover what HE actually wants vs. what others want for him. Grow up in his own way.

**Fears:**  
- Being without Zack
- Making wrong decisions alone
- Disappointing everyone
- Actually being dumb (not just playing dumb)
- Growing apart from his brother

**Secrets:**  
- Not sure he wants to go to college
- Sometimes exhausted by Zack's energy/plans
- Lonely even when surrounded by people
- Wishes someone would ask what HE wants

---

## Relationships

**With Zack (twin brother):**  
Worships his brother. Follows his lead always. Their separation/growth is key to his arc. Will have to learn to stand up to him, not reject him.

**With Parents:**  
Wants to please them but doesn't understand how. Feels like the "other" brother - less pressure but also less respect. Needs their validation more than Zack does.

**With Grandparents:**  
Actually curious about them (more than Zack is). Might have clearer memories of visits. More open to connection.

**With Delia (love interest):**  
Falls hard and fast. More genuine in his feelings than Zack initially. Wears heart on sleeve. His girl might see his potential before he does.

**With Elderly Community:**  
More naturally comfortable with them. Less judgment, more curiosity. They probably adopt him as grandson-figure. Enjoys hearing their stories.

**With Karen (noisy neighbor):**  
Running gag - forced encounters after getting caught. Blackmail comedy.

## Character Arc

**Starting Point:**  
Good-hearted follower with no identity of his own. Goes along with Zack's bad behavior because he doesn't know how to be separate. Immature but not malicious.

**Transformation:**  
Florida separation from their normal world forces him to make own choices. Elderly people treat him as individual, not "Zack's brother." Girl likes HIM specifically. Has to make moral choice independent of Zack.

**Ending Point:**  
Still loves and supports his brother, but has own voice. Makes own decisions. Knows who he is. Still goofy, but authentically so. Can disagree with Zack. Partners, not leader/follower.

**Key Moments:**  
1. Moment he has to make choice without Zack present
2. [Scene where elderly person treats him as individual]
3. First time he disagrees with Zack's plan
4. Stands up to Zack about something important
5. Makes final moral choice independently
6. [Moment where Zack follows HIS lead]

## Voice & Dialogue

**Speech Patterns:**  
Same bro-speak but less confident. "Uh..." and "like" more often. Trails off. Asks questions instead of declaring. Quotable because he's unintentionally funny.

More pop culture than Zack - cartoons, video games, comedies. Pauly Shore, Jim Carrey movies, video game references (Nintendo 64, PlayStation), Simpsons quotes

---

## Role in Comedy

**Comedy Type:**  
The dumb one. Physical comedy (falls, crashes, disguise malfunctions). Innocent questions that reveal truth. Unintentionally profound. Lovable idiot.

**Running Gags:**  
- Doesn't understand plan but goes along anyway
- Gets caught in compromising situations
- Says the wrong thing at wrong time (but it's endearing)
- The "noisy neighbor" situation - forced to sleep with her
- Elderly women love him (he's sweet and non-threatening)

**Comedic Relationships:**  
Perfect straight man to Zack's schemes. Comedy comes from his earnest confusion. Physical comedy when disguise fails.

---

## 90s-Specific Details

**Technology:**  
Has a pager but forgets to check it. Terrible at returning calls. Probably plays with grandparents' answering machine.

**Music Taste:**  
Whatever Zack likes, plus more mainstream pop. Backstreet Boys (secretly), Smash Mouth, Sugar Ray, pop-punk. Actually likes some of the "old music" the seniors play.

**TV Shows They Watch:**  
Same as Zack but also: Nickelodeon, cartoon network, WWE, gaming shows, would absolutely love "TRL"

**Cultural References:**  
Video games, toy culture, comic books, action figures, mall arcade, Pizza Hut, McDonald's promotions

---

## Visual Reference

**Actor/Celebrity Comp:**  
- Young Ashton Kutcher (Kelso from That '70s Show - lovable dummy)
- Seann William Scott (Stifler energy but nicer)
- Young Jason Segel (sweet giant goofball)
- Early Chris Pratt (before he got ripped)

**Style Icons:**  
Slightly behind Zack's style - whatever big brother wore last year

---

## Notes & Ideas

- His arc is quieter but maybe more meaningful - finding himself
- The noisy neighbor scene should be awkward comedy gold
- Might be first to genuinely bond with elderly residents
- His girl might be the more grounded of the two love interests
- Should have moment where he's actually BETTER at something than Zack
- Maybe he figures out the developer scheme first because he's listening
- More naturally suited to disguise because he's less cocky
- Probably takes the old person role too seriously (method acting)
- His "ultimate trick" contribution should require his specific skills
- End: Zack respects him as equal, not just little brother
