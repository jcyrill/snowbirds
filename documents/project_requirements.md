## 1. Concept & Premise

### High Concept
Two rich party-boy brothers disguise themselves as senior citizens to access a retirement community's world-class wakeboarding facility in 1990s Florida.

### Logline
When two wealthy San Francisco brothers lose their college fund after trashing an old folks' event in Lake Tahoe, they're shipped off to their grandparents' Florida retirement community. To train for a Miami wakeboarding competition that could pay for college, they must disguise themselves as senior citizens to access the community's elite facilities—learning respect and values from the "old people" they once disrespected.

### Premise
This is an 80s-style raunchy sex comedy set in the 1990s. Two jock brothers (Zack & Kyle) spend their summer wakeboarding, partying, and womanizing in Lake Tahoe on their parents' dime. After drunkenly ruining something important to a group of elderly people, their parents use their college fund to pay for damages and ship them off to live with their grandparents in a Florida retirement community (think The Villages).

When the grandparents immediately leave on a cruise, the brothers discover the community has a world-class wakeboarding facility—but it's restricted to residents 65+. Desperate to train for a Miami competition with prize money that could restore their college fund, they disguise themselves as old people. Hilarity ensues as they navigate the surprisingly raunchy world of Florida retiree culture while learning life lessons, falling for local girls, and facing off against an evil real estate developer trying to take over the community.
