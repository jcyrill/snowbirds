# Summary: *Snow Birds*

Privileged wakeboarding twins Zack and Kyle destroy a retirement community’s lakeside memorial for a beloved cat in Lake Tahoe, using up their college fund and earning a one-way ticket to Florida to work for their grandparents. In the Villages-style community they find a secret world-class wakeboarding facility, so they disguise themselves as retirees and sneak in to train while navigating the raunchy chaos of senior culture and the conscience of nurses Daisy and Delia. When greedy developer Rick Vantrell and his sons try to force the community into a drugged-up buyout—quietly turning seniors into zombies who stop caring about golf, tennis, or wakeboarding—the brothers are exposed, lose their cover, and believe their wakeboarding dreams are over until the seniors quietly rally to help. Using retiree connections, the twins earn a Miami competition spot, land the “Whirlybird” (a tantrum into a 360 front flip without a handle pass), and win the prize money. Instead of keeping the payoff, they secretly extinguish the hidden debt Vantrell held over the community, while a retiree-run scholarship funds their admission to party-school California Beach State and their parents finally admit they’ve changed. The film closes with the twins in a classroom, and the seniors cheering them on, showing that the real victory was growing up and learning from the generation they once mocked.
