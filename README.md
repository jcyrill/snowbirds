## Workflow

1. **Planning Phase** → `documents/` and `research/`
2. **Character Development** → `characters/`
3. **Story Structure** → `story/`
4. **Writing** → `drafts/`
5. **Revision** → Update `drafts/` with new versions

## File Naming Conventions

### Drafts
- Use version numbers: `snowbirds_v1.0.fountain`, `snowbirds_v1.1.fountain`, etc.
- Or date stamps: `snowbirds_2025-11-30.fountain`
- Major versions (1.0, 2.0) = complete drafts
- Minor versions (1.1, 1.2) = revisions within a draft

### Other Files
- Use descriptive lowercase names with hyphens
- Example: `main-characters.md`, `act-2-outline.md`

## Recommended Software

- **Fountain Format**: Plain text screenplay format (can open in any editor)
- **Final Draft**: Industry standard (exports to .fdx)
- **Fade In**: More affordable alternative
- **Highland 2**: Great for Fountain files
- **WriterDuet**: Web-based collaboration
